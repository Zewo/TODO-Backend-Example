This repository contains an implementation of Todo Backend created using Zewo components.

> The Todo-Backend project helps showcase and compare different language and framework combinations for building web services. This website defines a simple web API in the form of a todo list and users can create their own identical APIs using various tech stacks. This website then provides a spec runner to verify that the user implementation is identical to the base implementation.

## Architecture
The application is split up into three components: [Models](https://github.com/Zewo/TodoBackend/tree/master/Sources/TodoBackend/Models), [Resources](https://github.com/Zewo/TodoBackend/tree/master/Sources/TodoBackend/Resources), and [Storage](https://github.com/Zewo/TodoBackend/tree/master/Sources/TodoBackend/Storage).

### Models
The `Models` directory contains the bare minimum for the Todo model and avoids giving it state/optionality by abstracting its "entity" behavior (`id`, `url`) in `Entity` (from [SQL](https://github.com/Zewo/SQL)) and `TodoURLMiddleware`. There is also a conformance to `ModelProtocol` which describes what `Todo` looks like in a database, giving it access to the [SQL](https://github.com/Zewo/SQL) ORM.

### Resources
The resources directory contains a single resource which defines all of the routes. Most of the hard work (defining the routes, converting to and from JSON) is done by Zewo modules, the code inside the resource is just glue that interacts with the data store.

### Storage
For Storage, we define a `TodoStore` protocol which defines the necessary methods for interacting with a data store (fetch, insert, update, remove). A simple in-memory implementation of the protocol is included which just uses a dictionary for storage, which is nice when developing. The real data store is of course PostgreSQL, communication with which is implemented in `PostgreSQLTodoStore`.

Thanks to this architecture, our application's code is simple to understand, boilerplate-free, and highly maintainable. While this is by no means a perfect architecture, it can be a good example to follow for your own application.

## Setup
### Setting up the environment
You can follow the setup instructions for Zewo in the [main readme](https://github.com/Zewo/Zewo).

### Running the project locally
Simply clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/Zewo/TodoBackend.git`) and run `swift build`. Once the build process finishes, an executable for the application should pop up at `.build/debug/TodoBackend`.

### Deploying the project with Docker
To begin, clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/Zewo/TodoBackend.git`) and [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

#### Basic Deployment
There is a simple Dockerfile in the root of the repository that installs Swift, builds the application, and runs it.

Once you have the Dockerfile configured, build the docker image (`docker build -t zewo/todobackend .`). With the image built, run it using the [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) family of commands. For example, `docker run -itd -e API_ROOT="http://localhost/" -p 80:8080 zewo/todobackend` will start a container running the Todo Backend application in the background, and map the containers `8080` port to the machine's `80` (default http) port.

#### Docker Compose
When deploying the application to production, we want to store the todos in a real database. With Docker, the recommended way to do this is to use Docker Compose which runs multiple docker containers and allows them to communicate.

Included in the repository is an example configuration (`docker-compose.yml`). The configuration does need to be adjusted depending on the ip of the deployed application which should be relfected in the environmental variable API_ROOT. Afterwards, just run `docker-compose up` and Docker will handle the rest. Since PostgreSQL takes some time to start up, you may have to run the command twice.

## Support
If you need any help you can join our [Slack](http://slack.zewo.io) and go to the **#help** channel. Or you can create a Github [issue](https://github.com/Zewo/Zewo/issues/new) in our main repository. When stating your issue be sure to add enough details, specify what module is causing the problem and reproduction steps.
